<h1> Year Up Bay Area (SF) </h1>
<P> Year Up Bay Area is a one-year, intensive training program that provides low-income young adults, ages 18-24, with a combination of hands-on skill development, college credits, and corporate internships. Since opening our doors in 2008, we have helped over 500 young adults cross the Opportunity Divide in the San Francisco Bay Area. 88% of our graduates are employed (earning competitive wages) or are attending college within four months of completing the program. </p>

<h1> The program's sole purpose </h1>
<h1>  </h1>


<p>
  At Year Up, participants ages 18 to 24 get six months of technical and corporate-culture training and a six-month internship. Then the vast majority find jobs with the regionâ€™s top high-tech companies like Salesforce, Cisco, Yahoo and Facebook. The San Francisco Year Up office takes in about 240 applicants per year, while nationally there are about 3,000 trainees.

  Those in the program pay nothing. In fact, they get paid $600 a month during the first six months of classroom training and $1,000 a month during their internship. They leave the program employable, making an average of $44,000 per year.

</p>


<h1> With 5 tracks available to choose from  </h1>

<p> Each new student will be exposed to different areas of tech and given the opportunity to express interest on a specific track. As the L and D phase progresses, each student will get to see how each track functions. There are courses that show some level of each track and explain what the work environment may be like.

     </p>


<h1> Support from staff, advisors, and mentors </h1>

<p>
With help from staff members, each student will be granted a set of advisors and later on in the program, mentors. Guidance is something that Year Up wants to place with all of their students in order for them to reach success.
