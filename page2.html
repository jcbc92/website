<h1> Joe Louis VS Max Schmeling </h1>

<img src="images/JoevsMax.jpg" alt="joevsmax" width="400" height="400"/>
<p>
This was a fight to remember due to the fact that one fighter was defending a nation and proving a wide set of audience that the color of his skins, did not define the person he is. Max on the other hand was fighting for Nazi Germany. While he had a sense of pride for his country, the message of black fighters was that they could not fight. These 2 would come to be good friends and even help each other financially. While for most folks that this was the fight to determine the superiority of  fighters based on how they look.

<p>  This was a fight that transcended boxing. Ali had become a symbol of the anti-establishment movement after refusing to be inducted to the US Army. Threatened with five years in prison he refused to step forward and was immediately stripped of his heavyweight title and had his boxing license suspended. It would be three years until he was once again allowed to lace up the gloves in a professional bout. The fight put 2 fighters as the main event for the fight of the century and a rivalry tha continued throughout their career.
