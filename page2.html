<h1> Ali vs Frazier  </h1>

<img src="images/Ali-vs-Frazier.jpg" alt="ali-vs=frazier" width="400" height="400"/>
<p>  This was a fight that transcended boxing. Ali had become a symbol of the anti-establishment movement after refusing to be inducted to the US Army. Threatened with five years in prison he refused to step forward and was immediately stripped of his heavyweight title and had his boxing license suspended. It would be three years until he was once again allowed to lace up the gloves in a professional bout. The fight put 2 fighters as the main event for the fight of the century and a rivalry tha continued throughout their career.
