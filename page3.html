<h1> Back Then </h1>
<p>  Historical evidence lead to the fact that boxing was prevalent in North Africa in 4000 BC. It was also popularly played in Greek and Rome. The rules were crude then and boxers often indulged in lethal boxing rounds with leather taped on their bare hands. It is believed that In Ancient Rome, the boxing fighters were usually offenders and slaves. They played the game to win and gain independence. However, facts also point to free men fighting for competition and the spirit of sport. Eventually, Augustus is known to have banned fighting. It is also said that in 500 A.D. Theodoric banned the sport, owing to its popularity and growing distraction caused in public life.

<p> Many say that Boxing officially started in the 1600s the time when British Nobles had their servant box each other for the sole purpose of entertaining. At least the first fight was recorded in this era, many fights have gone unrecorded but are not denied that were boxing matches. The fights began to cross boundaries when slaves are thrown into ring with non-slaves. This was seen as entertaining in those times when the average life was seen dull and the call for such events were demonstrated. The fights held in those times had a lot of gambling involved where bets were placed on the most competent fighters. This was a popular thing to do to earn money and to gain popularity among the town and cities in Western Europe.
