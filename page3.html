<h1> The track that you have to be in </h1>
<p>Year Up’s Quality Assurance training teaches students how to test computer software and websites for bugs
and errors. Q.A. students learn the basics of the software development lifecycle, how to read and analyze
application requirements, how to execute manual and automated tests, and how to track and report software
defects- all using industry-standard tools and techniques.
</p>

<h1>   Why?   </h1>

<p>
Quality Assurance Professionals have multiple personalities when working. They are the project manager, developer, customer service, tech savvy customer, non tech savvy customer, angry customer, lazy customer, sales representative and last but not least the quality assurance professional. Obviously your quality assurance personality is the most important because you are allowed to be all of these people but you understand that the company’s “BRAND” is the most important thing.Knowing this.
Many students who enter the QA track have been able to apply their skills in troubleshooting and identifying bugs that occur in the application. Through tools such as Jira, students gain the fundamentals to learn what is a bug and what is intentional. It doesn't stop there, other concepts are brought up such as methodologies that are used in the field. These include: Big Bang, Waterfall, Spiro, Code/fix, and Agile. As time moves on and technology continues to change, new concepts are talked about such as automation testing. Of course the class makes sure that it is still maintaining some of its core concepts such as black box testing and white box testing.
